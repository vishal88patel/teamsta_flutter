# Teamsta

Still in development stage

## Branches

- production = This branch is for live code.(Production branch can only be merged from Beta if stable)

- beta = This branch is for live testing (Testing will insure stability before merging with production, beta will only be merged by dev when dev is ready)

- dev = This branch is where code is merged (This is the development branch and will be the main branch from which we pull daily and push once our feature branches are ready.)

- feature = feature branches are to be deleted when complete (the feature branch you create must be named after the code you are writing eg: login_page or Login_ui. when complete it will be merged into dev)

- bugFix = This branch is for bug fixes and will be deleted on completion (bugFix branches will be used to fix issues and merged with dev when complete.)
